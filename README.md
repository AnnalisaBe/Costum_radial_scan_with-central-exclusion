# Costum_radial_scan_with central exclusion

This folder contains tools for study signals spreding radially from the edge of a central circle, with the possiblity to confine the radial scan to a certain angle intervall.

The analysis is made of two parts:

PART 1: image analisys in Fiji

PART 2: data analysis in R


PART 1 can be conducted with two different macros, depending on whether we are dealing with a single-channel or dual-channel image series. Dual-channel macro allows to register the image series based on one channel of choice and to apply the same transformation matrix to the other channel.
